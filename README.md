"Work to live, or live to work? A correlational study between job satisfaction and work-life balance."

---

Although I’ve had a few jobs in the past, I have yet to work for a company where I felt that I belonged, or I felt that “this is my career.” Nothing motivated me to work except for a paycheck or maybe my coworkers. I have many friends who say they love their company, or they love what they do, so I, too, want to experience that rather than feeling expendable and never appreciated for my hard work. Work is inevitable, so I believe we should create an uplifting and positive environment that makes us happy to wake up every day and want to go to work. We only get one life; we should make something meaningful out of it rather than have our mental health deteriorate simply because we are unhappy.

### Purpose
I believe that the relationship between JS and WLB is often misunderstood in terms of what actually is the causing factor to why employees are not happy or why they choose to leave their jobs. Gounder (2018) states that the importance of these variables shouldn’t be overlooked since satisfied employees are more inclined to display positive organizational citizenship behavior and commitment, which is optimal to the organization's growth. Fairlie (2011) argues that organizations should promote meaningfulness in the employees' work and nonwork lives. This study will generate a new perspective that will benefit organizations to understand how levels of job satisfaction are influenced by the effects of work-life balance, enhancing the knowledge of how gender preferences, beliefs, and behaviors vary from one another.

Although job satisfaction (JS) and work-life balance (WLB) are constantly being researched, the wide range of this research leads to the understanding that employees have various perspectives of their organization and the nature of their employment, which cannot be generalized.

### Job Satisfaction 
As defined by Mosadeghrad and Yarmohammadian (2006), job satisfaction is an individual's perceptions about one's occupation and the organization in which they accomplish these duties are reflected in their level of work satisfaction. Wanous and Lawler (1972) state that during the course of their employment, employees gain both intrinsic and extrinsic components that are linked to certain characteristics of job satisfaction, such as self-determination, autonomy, communication, and growth. However, Raziq and Maulabakhsh (2015) argue that uncertainty, feeling unsafe, and doubting one's level of respect result in employees drifting away from the company.

*Antecedents*
* Personality
* Values
* Work environment
* Social influence

*Consequences*
* Organizational commitment
* Turnover
* Citizenship behavior
* Absenteeism
* Employee well-being

In order to mitigate these consequences, organizations should offer flexible and positive working environments so that employees may feel appreciated and valued for their contributions, rather than just an object. Being able to have platonic connections, interact with coworkers, and express good emotions helps to promote happiness and a pleasant work environment.

### Work-Life Balance 

Work-life balance is defined as a person's ability to simultaneously manage the emotional, behavioral, and temporal pressures of full-time employment and personal and family commitments (Hill et al., 2001). In today’s society, the traditional expectations for work include the push for a 40+ hour work week, which leaves little time for balance, and in turn induces higher stress levels, affects life quality, and impairs performance (Greenhaus et al., 2003) Proper work-life balance should encompass maintaining an overall sense of harmony in work, pleasure, family, and recovery, with minimal role conflict (AlHazemi & Ali, 2016; Brough et al., 2020).

*Antecedents*
* Work overload
* Working long hours
* Unsupportive supervisor
* Inflexible schedule/overtime
* Marital status
* Child and eldercare responsibility
* Age of children
* Unsupportive family members

*Consequences*
* Decreased productivity
* Poor performance
* Absenteeism
* High turnover
* Low job satisfaction
* Strained family relations
* Health disorders (depression, headache, stress, anxiety)
* Low family satisfaction

Since the introduction of remote work, it has become easy for personal stress to seep into the office, which may induce high levels of stress and employee disengagement. Ahmad (2013) believes that poor work quality contributes to poor living conditions, or vice versa. 

### A Gender Perspective 
Karkoulian et al (2016) state that gender plays a significant role as it affects how people perceive events, cope with those events, and present themselves in terms of their ability to manage their responsibilities. Due to the rise of women in the workforce and dual-income families, Bhalla (2016) indicates that the work-life balance has become a challenge for men and women.

**Men** work longer hours to fulfill financial obligations, which puts them under more stress or causes role overload. They prefer having more flexibility in their work schedule or the opportunity to work from home.

**Women** take on responsibilities and tasks in personal and work-life roles, which causes a higher degree of work overload and stress. Expresses emotions of anxiety and guilt over feeling like they could not handle all of their tasks. They are likely to suffer due to a lack of adaptability in managing homeschooling, day care, and work.

(Greenhaus et al. (2003); Guest (2002); Hjálmsdóttir and Bjarnadóttir (2021)).

### Hypothesis & Methodology
After reading previous research articles, what did I want to prove or disprove? I hypothesized that there is a correlation between job satisfaction and work-life balance, and that correlation is moderated by gender. 

To conduct my research, an online quantitative survey (Google Forms) will be used to collect data from participants. Participants will be recruited to participate through convenience and snowball sampling (social media, direct messages, and email). An informed consent section will assure the participants of confidentiality and anonymity. The target population was 18+ year olds who were employed (full or part-time) at the time. To have 80% power to detect correlations of at least r = 0.15 (two tails), a sample size calculator indicated that 347 participants are needed.

Out of 207 participants, 53% indicated they were female, while 45% indicated they were male. The participants responded to 15 statements using a 5-point Likert scale (1 = Strongly Disagree, 5 = Strongly Agree) to indicate their feelings of job satisfaction and how balanced their work-life is. 

(Brayfield and Rothe (1951); Macdonald and MacIntyre (1997); Neyogt (2020); Banu and Duraipandian (2014); Hayman (2005); “How to measure” (n.d.)).

### Results 

**Correlation**
* A correlation analysis was run for the main variables in the table shown.
* JS has a fairly strong correlation with WLB, where the Pearson’s Correlation coefficient is 0.58, with a p-value of < 0.01.
* The other correlations were not significant.

**Moderator Analysis**
* A moderator analysis was used to test the moderating effect of gender.
* The interaction of JS and WLB with gender is shown to be nearly significant, with a p-value of 0.095.
* The interaction had an unstandardized beta coefficient of -0.18, standard error of 0.11, standardized coefficient of -0.13, and t-value of -1.68.

In today's workplace, job satisfaction and maintaining a well-balanced work-life are the most challenging issues to deal with. Studies show that job satisfaction and work-life balance have a notable influence on employees' motivation, which in turn affects productivity and the overall success of the organization. The results from this study indicated that there is a significant correlation between job satisfaction and work-life balance, and the effects of gender slightly influence that relationship. Karkoulian et al. (2016) state that men and women have different approaches to dealing with work-life conflict and differing expectancies for their responsibilities at work and home. 

This study can provide organizations with crucial knowledge on how to minimize disputes and cultivate work-life balance among all employees in the workplace. Organizations can implement family-friendly programs, such as flexible work hours, parental leave, childcare assistance, and flexible work rules, to help employees achieve work-life balance. They can also provide the necessary skills and training to resolve internal disputes and misunderstandings to reduce the overall stress level of the workplace. Leadership can cultivate a culture of empowerment, fostering a sense of belonging, cooperation, and self-expression among employees. They can also develop challenging and rewarding work or find methods to give their employees unique projects or assignments that accomplish the same goal (Alegre et al., 2016; Fan, 2018; Feeney & Stritch, 2017; Aziri, 2011). 

In doing so, organizational commitment and job satisfaction may be improved if companies engage in management programs to assist employees to better juggle work and personal obligations (Fan, 2018). An essential first step in making better choices that will impact employees is to assess how their employees feel through pulse surveys or frequent check-ins so they may express their opinions and thoughts. However, minimizing stress is not solely dependent on the organization. Employees must also develop a plan by being cognizant of their current lifestyle and recognizing their responsibilities and goals.

**Limitations**
* Participants' employment and stress levels were influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic. As many workers were forced to work from home, some organizations required their employees to return to the office, which forced them to reevaluate how they spent their time outside of work.
* Although the demographics were not included to focus on the hypothesis, additional findings suggest that remote work was negatively correlated with work-life balance. As the pandemic continues and remote work is becoming the norm, it would be interesting if future research looked into the gender perceptions of the effects of remote work.
* The sample population could not be generalized since the data were collected using an online self-report survey, which recorded responses at a specific point in time. It did not account for the participant's emotions at that moment, or they could have been dishonest in selecting responses by rushing to complete the survey.
* The method approach did not offer additional insight into how participants perceive their relevant work experiences due to the 5-point Likert scale.

### What's Next? 
To overcome these limitations, future research should utilize a qualitative research design to get accurate interpretations of how employees contribute to a given situation. As men and women have different attitudes and experiences, using qualitative research as it can help employers build proper initiatives that meet their specific requirements. Fan (2018) suggests that conducting interviews is a practical approach to get data on workplace practices since they may reveal preconceptions and subconscious standards. 

Also, obtaining a larger sample size may overcome the design restriction, as it could be applied to the general population. Additionally, Aziri (2011) notes that job satisfaction has six factors that contribute separately to the employees’ overall level of satisfaction, which include the nature of work, pay, promotion, supervisors, colleagues, and working conditions. This would be interesting for future studies to isolate the JB Scale, as it could provide a deeper understanding of the interrelationships between these factors and the influence of work-life balance (Aziri, 2011; Fan, 2018). 


### Conclusion 

With that being said, as the number of women in the workforce is increasing, and dual-income families are becoming more frequent, men and women must find common ground on how to balance their personal and professional life. Theorists propose that it is crucial to bring awareness to the elements that influence and jeopardize an individual's satisfaction and quality of life in the workforce. Insights from this research can prove advantageous for organizations that struggle with sustaining employee retention and overall satisfaction by developing practices that will establish a positive cultural shift. Organizations are encouraged to think about their employees’ circumstances beyond the conventional scope of the office, which extends into their families’ domains.

With that, this concludes my research on job satisfaction and work-life balance with the moderating effect of gender. Thank you all for your time in reading my thesis. I hope you found this insightful!
